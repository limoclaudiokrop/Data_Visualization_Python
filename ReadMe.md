# Data Visualization Python

## Spotify Dataset
The dataset for this tutorial tracks global daily streams on the music streaming service Spotify. We focus on five popular songs from 2017 and 2018:

1. "Shape of You", by Ed Sheeran (link)
2. "Despacito", by Luis Fonzi (link)
3. "Something Just Like This", by The Chainsmokers and Coldplay (link)
4. "HUMBLE.", by Kendrick Lamar (link)
5. "Unforgettable", by French Montana (link)



Notice that the first date that appears is January 6, 2017, corresponding to the release date of "The Shape of You", by Ed Sheeran. And, using the table, you can see that "The Shape of You" was streamed 12,287,078 times globally on the day of its release. Notice that the other songs have missing values in the first row, because they weren't released until later!

## Analysis
From the above graph, the songs follow a bell curve. That is the streams rapidly grows after the songs is released, reaches a peak and then gradually falls as time passes. Additionally although different songs might have different streams at the begining or the peak, they generally fall to about the same streams in the long run.
