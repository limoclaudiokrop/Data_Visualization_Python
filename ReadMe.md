# Data Visualization Python
Below is a summary of projects on data visualization in python using seaborn. The projects features lineplot, bar charts, scatter plots, swarm plots, heat map, Density plots, KDE plots and 2KDE plots.
Please check the individual projects for more details about the dataset and code implementation.
# Iris Flower Dataset 
The dataset contains 150 different flowers, or 50 each from three different species of iris (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica).

### Analysis
One interesting pattern that can be seen in plots is that the plants seem to belong to one of two groups, where Iris versicolor and Iris virginica seem to have similar values for petal length, while Iris setosa belongs in a category all by itself.
In fact, according to this dataset, we might even be able to classify any iris plant as Iris setosa (as opposed to Iris versicolor or Iris virginica) just by looking at the petal length: if the petal length of an iris flower is less than 2 cm, it's most likely to be Iris setosa!

## Spotify Dataset
The dataset for this tutorial tracks global daily streams on the music streaming service Spotify. We focus on five popular songs from 2017 and 2018: "Shape of You", by Ed Sheeran, "Despacito", by Luis Fonzi, "Something Just Like This", by The Chainsmokers and Coldplay, "HUMBLE.", by Kendrick Lamar and"Unforgettable", by French Montana

### Analysis
From the above graph, the songs follow a bell curve. That is the streams rapidly grows after the songs is released, reaches a peak and then gradually falls as time passes. Additionally although different songs might have different streams at the begining or the peak, they generally fall to about the same streams in the long run.
